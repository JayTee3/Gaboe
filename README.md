#### Description:
 GABOE is a Grade Management System design to assist teachers and students. Giving teachers  the ablity to record their
 academic records online and students the ability to view and keep track of their academic perfromance. GABOE come equip
 with a registeration form for both the teachers and students. This form can be UPGRADED to gather more information if
 needed by the institution. GABOE also has login pages for both teachers and students to access individual views as needed.

 Once logged in to the platform the profile for the teachers interface will have a **Profile** **Assessment** **Post Grade**
 links located on the navigation bar above. Each link will take the teacher/ user to different funtion within the system.
 First the profile will have widgets/cards which display information about an assignment that was given and graded by the teacher.
 The widget/card will have the title, date graded, category (i.e homework, classwork..) total points for the assignment, along
 with two buttons to view the assignment detials. This button will take the user to a table which displays the score the student
 receive as well as an average for the assignment. Within this view a teacher/user can edit the students grade information by
 clicking on the student's name within the table. In addition to the view assignment buttom the widget/card will have a delete
 button which does exactly that, deletes the information about the assignment.

 Secondly the assessment page will give teachers/users the ability to create an assignment. This area will take a assignment title,
 date, category, and point total. Once the teacher/ user has created an assignment they will be sent to the post grade page. Where the
 teacher/user will be able to post the scores for the students.

 Thirdly within the profile page within the teacher's account the left side bar will contain a list of students currently within the
 teacher/users class. clicking on the name of the student will display current the student in questions details (i.e parent information
 and other detials as needed by the institution).Along with a table displaying the academic information (i.e student grades for each subject/
 class he/she is enrolled in) and the averages for the classes/subject along with all of the assignment he/she would have turned in.
